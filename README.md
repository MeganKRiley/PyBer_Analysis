# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
Performing analysis of ride share data for Pyber over a five month period to make a comparitive assessment of the data based on city type. 

## Resources
Softwares: Python 3.7.6, Anaconda 4.10.1, Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources: city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results

 - Total Riders
   - The total amount of riders in urban city types is actually more than twice as much as riders in suburban city types and rural city types combined.  

 - Total Drivers
    - While it isn't surprising to see that urban city types have the highest total amount of drivers based off our total riders data, it is surprising to see just how many more drivers they have than the other two city types.  Urban city types have more than *4 times* the amount of drivers that suburban and rural city types have combined. 

 - Total Fares
    - Despite the statistics for total riders and total drivers in urban city types showing over twice as many occurances than suburban and rural city types combined, this isn't the case when it comes to total fares.  Urban areas did have the highest total fares, but not by as high of a percentage as in the cases of total riders and total drivers. 

 - Average Fare Per Ride
    - The total fares statistics make a lot of sense when you look at the average fare per ride in each city type.  Rural areas have the highest average fare per ride, which means that even though they have less riders, each ride is going to have a bigger impact on total fares.  

 - Average Fare Per Drivers
    - It is fair to say there is a direct coorelation between the amount of drivers in an area and how much the average ride will cost.  Rural areas have the least amount of drivers, but the average ride cost per driver is more than *3x* the average cost in an urban area.  

### Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, I can provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing the disparities among the three city types.  The three recommendations work directly together, not in a step-by-step manner.  Essentially, Pyber needs to get more drivers in rural areas, get more riders in rural areas, and lower the rates in rural areas.  I mention that these work directly together because they need to launch at the same time in order to work off of one another.  Lowering the rates in rural areas could happen naturally if there were more drivers, but there will only become more drivers if there are more riders, and you will only get more riders with lower fares.  Implementing incentives for first time riders and new drivers, and having more affordable fares will allow this to happen. While performing these three things at once could have a minor setback in revenue over a brief period of time, it would open up the Pyber market to an entirely new area, which would over time increase revenue drastically, and bring the metrics on rural areas and urban areas closer together.
